A Pen created on CodePen.

This is a simple example of a page transition I created for a client website. Normally, you'd have a framework like Highway JS, although I suppose you could adapt this into Vue or React. This example just uses classes with timeouts in order to create the effect, but in reality you would set this up to be a page transition in your language. I like to use the Images Loaded library (https://imagesloaded.desandro.com/) to make sure all my images are loaded before I bring in the next page.
